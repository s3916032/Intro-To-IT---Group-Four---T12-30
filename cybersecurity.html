        <h3>What is cybersecurity?</h3>
        <p>Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting networks, data, and devices, in other words, sensitive information, from digital attacks. (CISA, 2019). Cybersecurity enforces secrecy, integrity, and availability of computer systems and data as they can be impaired by those with criminal intent or unauthorised access. It is the art of enforcing law and order in the virtual world. To separte authorized access from unauthorised ess, the computer mut understand who it is communicating with. This is done through authentication. Authentication comes in three different sub-categories: “What you know?”, “What you have?” and “What you are?” (CrashCourse, 2017).  The first type consists of providing knowledge that should only be accessible to you, of which the most widely used method is by supplying the computer a username and a password. Password security was introduced to computing in the 1960s and is still widely prevalent to this day (Lennon, 2017). Although currently there are many practices implemented, such as the enforced inclusion of symbols, capital letters, and numbers in a password, this authentication process can be used to represent a person virtually regardless of whether they are physically present. To expand, unauthorised parties can compromise the security of an individual’s personal information if they happen to guess or discover someone's password. The “What you have?” type of cybersecurity works with a token or a key that a user must possess to unlock sensitive information. Like a password, there is a possibility of burglary or impersonation. Due to this, the biggest technology companies are now starting to implement biometrics. Biometrics are considered to fall into the “What you are?” category of authentication. Biometrics is the measurement of biological or physical attributes that can be used to identify individuals (Kaspersky, 2021). Key early implementations of biometrics would be the FBI’s investment into fingerprinting databases in the 1970s, this investment paved the way for the normalization of fingerprinting “perps” in most police organizations. This made it hard for perpetrators to give false information, as items such as IDs can be easily falsified, a fingerprint serves as a truly unique identifier for databases as they are exponentially more difficult to alter/hide (Inpeaks, 2021).  A present-day example of biometrics being used effectively would be fingerprinting when exiting and or entering various countries via customs. Customs stations will use a person’s biometrics to add them into their databases if it is their first entry. However, when theirs an existing data reference for the biometrics, they can easily check if the person is who they say they are or if they are wanted by Interpol for certain offenses, for example. The biometrics aid in the customs process in deterring and apprehending smugglers, criminals, and other unwanted profiles. In the past 20 years, the use of biometrics has seen a rapid increase, with fingerprints, facial recognition, voice recognition, and retina scans presenting themselves as a form of identification on mobile phones. Cybersecurity's expected advancements will see the recede of passwords and plastic cards as they are difficult to use and are easily misplaced. The future of biometric security will aspire to strive for simplicity (RecFaces, 2020). The future possess many interesting outcomes, we will no longer need to remember passwords or even programs that store passwords, all we will need to remember is that our faces and fingers are keys for the future. It is truly exciting to have the prospect of forgetting house/car keys and having little to no drawbacks.  In the coming years, developments in cybersecurity and biometrics will revolutionise the healthcare and medical industries. These advancements free staff from the unproductive and time-consuming work of constantly entering logins, passwords, and patient details, automating and streamlining the whole process (RecFaces, 2020).There will be new personal assistance apparatuses that we can’t even imagine yet, there will be Biotech that helps regulate different organs as well as displaying information to the users. These technologies will be able to warn users of possible heart attacks/strokes or other life-threatening conditions, and this will be possible when the cybersecurity industry rapidly catches up, which it will, sooner than we can imagine.

        <h3>What are the impacts and who will it affect?</h3>
        <p>A key impact that will be at the forefront of the rapid progression of Cybersecurity is the removal of physical keys and plastic cards from circulation. With a large portion of adults having at least 4 credit cards on average (CNBC,2020), not taking into account membership and rewards cards, this is millions if not billions of plastic cards that we stuff into our wallets and purses. A lot of these cards have expiry dates or go unused, adding to the already overwhelming pollution caused by the plastics and petrochemical industry. However, with advancements in cybersecurity, we will soon be able to store all of our bank, rewards, and membership cards in one place. That “one place” could be our fingertips, eliminating the need for pollution-promoting physical cards. Another example of a positive environmental impact that cybersecurity enables is through services such as My Health Record on the My Gov page. When opted in, all health records for any single patient are stored in the My Health Record database. All blood tests, X-rays and doctor notes are all uploaded to your private and secure profile where you can view your history of medical events. Eliminating physical copies lessens the wastage of paper and plastic that was conventionally used to display results. In addition to the minuscule waste, delivery times are cut as digital files are being uploaded as opposed to physical files sent in the mail. As with most websites and files, none of this is safe without encryption, the goal is to make it only accessible to those with passwords or decryption keys. In this example, My Health Records is hypothetically a secure service (Knowing the Australian government it probably isn’t), I could still lose sensitive information on various other sites to phishing and scams. These hackers could now potentially have access to a vast number of accounts (OneLogin, 2021) and breach private services. This will be somewhat avoided in the future when phish-able passwords are replaced by complex biometric encryptions, of course, hackers will always exist and there will have to be countermeasures for when those issues arise.  Advancements in cybersecurity will also promote the digitalization of keychains. Most of us carry around keychains with keys to our, house, car, bike, and various other secure items. All of these physical keys will have the ability to be turned into digital keys, your body can open and secure anything you desire. With enhancements in biometrics and encryptions always being improved upon, people will start to see it is far more appealing to have a digital defence in their product as opposed to a mechanical lock which is far easier to manipulate and break.  Whether it’s microchips or biometrics, all of our “keys” will eventually be stored in the same place, simplifying various aspects of our daily lives. We will most likely see an increase in Locksmiths that specialise in cyber security and encryption. This possibly making conventional Locksmiths redundant as physical locks will be replaced by impregnable encryptions, pushing a lot of conventional Locksmiths to adapt their skills to the digital world. It could be fair to assume that conventional Locksmiths could become the same as shoe shiners, a niche antique profession that doesn’t really serve the masses anymore. On the other hand, advancements in the IT world will always spur new professions and positions, so we will likely see a baton change for the Locksmithing world.

        <h3>How will this affect my personal life, family and friends? </h3>
        <p>My daily life will be transformed as cybersecurity constantly evolves and improvements are optimised and implemented into our everyday routines. For one I can't wait to be able to log into any site or service with just my biometrics. You can’t even begin to imagine how many times I have pressed the “forgot password?” button, it is simply embarrassing, it has made me question my sanity in more than one instance. Therefore, having a system where all I will ever need is my face or finger seems like a fever dream to me.   Making aspects of the world simpler and streamlined is one of the most attractive prospects of technology, I see it having an abundance of benefits that don’t just serve me.  I imagine streamlining security to these extents will create more accessibility for the elderly and or disabled people, it’s nice to know that when my parents get old, they won’t have to worry about; remembering passwords, carrying keys, and their health could be monitored remotely and securely with the advancements of technology in the coming years. Digital safety for passwords and sensitive information is always important and it's nice to have more convenience but it pales in comparison to your own personal safety and health. That is the most important aspect of cybersecurity in the future, it will evolve from securing info and passwords to being an active safeguard within our bodies
