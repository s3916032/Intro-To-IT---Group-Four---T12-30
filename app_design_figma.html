        <h4>Our goal is to market our product to the public; therefore, the user's experience should be a primary focus. I nominated myself to work on designing the user interface for our app because I have an. My background is in art, which is why think this is an area where I made a significant contribution to our efforts. After establishing the initial framework for what our app needed, I incorporated my prior skills and knowledge which resulted in my extracting various elements from our discussions and developing visual concepts.</h4>
        <h4>My starting point began after we brainstormed ideas on what we wanted and needed to include. Then I started sketching those ideas for our logo and brand name. We had not selected a brand name at this stage, so I took the liberty of choosing one. My progress documentation at the end of this report. Refer to page [xx] if you would like to view that information. The chosen name is ‘Lock Box’. </h4>

        <h3>Scope and Limits </h3>
        <p>For our app to be successful I needed to design a unique and recognisable logo. We also need to provide the user with an engaging and intuitive interface. I am no graphic designer nor is this a design course. The work I have produce will require alterations to be conducted by a professional when it comes to an official launch. The logo represents a lock and a Wi-Fi signal. It simple and intuitive which is important when designing a compelling product or brand.</p>
        <p>I believe it’s important that everyone saw what I was doing so we were all on the same page. Putting the elements together was fun and exciting but if I didn’t have my team provide their opinions, I wouldn’t have had any direction to follow. Developing a visual layout of an app demands external input from the designer. Otherwise, it will result in the team having a conflict of expectations, I believe it was important to get constant feedback from everyone, so we were all able to compromise and progress with our ideas. </p>
        <p>Another important aspect was designing the lock/unlock feature and the placement within the app. This is the primary purpose of our app, which is to enable the user to remotely lock/unlock one of our boxes. It needed to be placed in an obvious spot. We discussed this as a team and I made notes and sketches from that talk, please refer to page [xx]. After I presented the feedback to the first group, I added the areas that will need to be improved over the coming weeks.</p>
        <p>Here are the links to the designs:</p><br>

        <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
        <p>A challenging aspect was designing a compelling logo. I am no graphic designer nor is this a design course. Alterations would need to be made to my designs by a professional when it comes to an official launch. The logo represents a lock and a Wi-Fi signal. It simple and intuitive which is important when designing a compelling product or brand. </p>
        <p>I chose red as the primary colour for our logo design but created multiple swatches to have the team go over and find the best design. I also shared it with a friend who is a graphic designer, and they provided some valuable feedback. They suggested using just two colours instead of three which I think aids in the more contemporary feel of our product. I was able to create the designs using the apps', Procreate, and Affinity Photo (an alternative to Photoshop). Both programs are tools I have a lot of experience in using. </p>
        <p>As well as developing the logo I spent the past several weeks developing the app UI. The primary goal for my aspect of this project was to develop an effective and appealing layout that maximised the user's experience. I used Figma to bring these designs to life. It was initially difficult learning how to use a new platform like this but once I played around with the tools, I was able to pick it up quickly. It has many elements that mirror image editing programs like Photoshop which made it easy to transfer prior knowledge over to this platform.</p>
        <p>During the development of the app development on Figma, I thought it was important to get feedback from the team. If you refer to page 3 on my progression notes you can see the initial layout was just too intense, at least that was the feedback from the team, but I didn’t have an issue with it. They said it was just a bit too much to look at and made it difficult for them to look at the screen. I thought the feedback was constructive and important to make note of what they liked/disliked. The final designs can be found on page [xx] of the progress document. </p>

        <h3>Testing</h3>
        <p>The initial testing phase was when I presented the Figma designs to the group. Upon the feedback, I performed further adjustments and each time major adjustments were made I shared it with the group. After this, I took the prototype to the first official test group which was comprised of both my parents and my older sister. Before I showed them the app, I gave them a brief overview of what our team had been working on and the intentions of our app. I then showed them the prototype and asked them to find and navigate towards certain things and let them play around for a few minutes. After that, I then asked them for feedback. I had prepared a questionnaire which I was going to give them to fill out. I based the questions on some quick research I did on how to gain insightful feedback on test groups for IT products. I then proceeded to not use the survey I made because it felt too formal, and I found it more beneficial to have them provide feedback in a casual conversation on which I made notes. In future stages of app development, I think it would be important to have used a tool like that to gain feedback from larger focus groups. With that said the information my family members provided was great.</p>
        <p>Overall feedback was positive, aside from the obvious biases, they said the prototype was easy to navigate and made sense. They also like the idea of the app and provided some great insight on what they would use the boxes for if they were available. They also provided some great feedback on how the app could be improved. Some of this included having a feature to notify users of a low power notification, providing users with the option to save contacts to share boxes within the future and even including a ‘family’ feature that can be shared with kids, so they don’t need to create their accounts. There are also several more features the provided ideas for which I think would be useful to spend time developing in the coming weeks. I have made note of this in our weekly project planner. </p><br>
