      <h2>Team Project - Portable Lockers</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="main-container">
      <div class="sub-container">
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>As a group we aim to create convenient and affordable “Taxi Box” style lockers for; public/national parks, train stations and public events that don’t require a physical key dongle but rather simply utilise smartphones in order to operate them. These lockers will be designed to be accompanied by an app for the users to be able to operate the product efficiently and as intended.</p>
        <p>Users will be able to set up and hire out certain lockers for set windows of time. Freeing people from worrying about the safety of their own clutter. </p>
        <p>The “Taxi Box” style means that there would be less city council hassle of placing the lockers.  The permanent construction route would come with a lot more issues to do with things such as; public land, building approvals as well as customisability/modularity constraints. </p>
        <p>With a transportable approach we would be able to overcome or diminish most of these hurdles. A transportable system also simplifies the process of up-scaling or down-scaling operations, in accordance to season, events and general demand. </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Motivation</h3>
        <p>At the start of lockdown in 2020 all of my (Alan) trainings were cancelled; I went from training 4-5 times a week to none. I did enjoy playing games and watching Netflix for about 2 weeks straight, but I realised that I had to get back to work. I decided to go to the park with a workout plan to stay fit and ready, hoping the spiciest of all coughs would just be a simple lemon and herb level. I planned to do 2 laps of around 2.7kms, skipping rope, a couple cones and a soccer ball to keep my ball skills in check. That means I had to bring; Running shoes, water bottle, earphones, phone, soccer boots, cones, skipping rope, ball and maybe even more… Now this is an exhaustive list, and I had the question “Where on God’s green Earth am I going to put all this crap?!”. I live a 5-10 walk minutes away from 3 big parks, I’m not going to drive 2 minutes with gear I can carry in one bag comfortably, but then again, I’m not leaving my bag of valuables in some random nook in the park whilst I run or work out with no assurances. </p>
        <p>So, I thought of this idea to help those people, like me, who go to parks (or other public areas) to work out and also bring valuables or a large quantity of items that can’t be looked after whilst in “session”. However, working with feedback from Ass1, team members and industry professionals, we have been able to expand use cases of lockers. As well as sticking true to the original target audience, it will now include more scenarios. </p>
        <p>Festivals: Attendees can store valuables that could otherwise get lost, damaged or stolen. </p>
        <p>CBD:  In peak holiday season, Tourists and the public alike, can store their belongings and purchases in one safe place without returning to their accommodation. Most likely located a stone's throw away from the various public transport hubs found all over the CBD, users won’t have to trudge around the city with a stack of bags all day. They can take the weight off their shoulders and focus on enjoying Melbourne! </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>The final desired outcome are still lockers similar to those in public pools and changing rooms at sport centres, but far more secure and catered specifically for mobile outdoor use. In addition to being sufficiently resilient our lockers will made with security in mind as they are in an open public park and not inside an institution/business that could monitor theft. </p>
        <p>Whilst that is our final vision, we have decided to undertake prototyping a small-scale version in order to provide a proof of concept and understand if we are able to achieve our desired outcomes within a contained unit first. </p>
        <p>Our current plan is to design and model a functioning electronic locking mechanism which is able to be unlocked and locked through the use of mobile app. After this basic functionality is achieved, we can look to expand upon both the lock aspect as well as the app aspect. Once we have reached a functional stage where we have finalized our chosen models to address each aspect, we can then look to expand the model to facilitate the use of multiple lockers/locks and users.  </p>
        <p>Users are able to access the lockers through the use of a proprietary app that we are aiming to develop. They simply pick a time, day and location and are able to store their belongings safely as long as necessary. Initially the functionality will be quite simple as we are all beginner programmers hoping to implement something that works. The app will aim to utilize the NFC functionality of most smartphones in order to communicate with an electronic lock. To begin with our aim is to simply implement a lock and unlock signal which can then be further expanded upon. </p>
        <p>Additional functionality we would like to be able to implement include a virtual token system which will allow one locker to be used by multiple users. An online booking system to dispense said tokens. We will need to impose time limitations on duration of booking due to mobile nature of our lockers. We are hoping our lockers will be viewed as temporary rather than permanent storage options by our users. Expanding upon bookings we would like to be able to securely manage payments as well as user data. This will require researching further storage options and secure payment gateway options but this is quite far down the track. If we get far enough then a map functionality with the locker locations embedded would be ideal. </p>
        <p>The lockers themselves are still something we are in detailed discussions about. The main focus of our project so far has been on the software and technical hardware side of things. We are yet to collect and compare possible solutions for locker production. As mobility is also a priority of ours traditionally secure but heavy lockers are not an ideal solution. Additionally due to the locks being electronic we would also require a mobile power supply for the lockers to function. This is a problem that is unique to our model due to the mobility factor and will thus require an innovative solution that might not already be present in this field. </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Technical Skills</h3>
        <p>We have tailored the project in order to be able to accomplish a basic goal with our limited skills. The idea is to establish a minimal baseline to then build on as we upskill ourselves in order to accomplish the goals we have already outlined. </p>
        <p>Skills that are pertinent regardless will be some level of programming knowledge. Experience with Swift or Kotlin would be ideal as we are developing an app targeted at smartphone users. This is where our primary objective for upskilling lies as none of us in our group consider ourselves competent app developers just yet. </p>
        <p>Additionally some level of hardware knowledge when it comes to components such as NFC reader, Pis and Arduinos would be extremely beneficial as these are all components that we have identified as essential for our desired outcome. Thus in order to be able to construct a working prototype some level of knowledge pertaining to these components is a definite necessity.  </p>

        <h3>Prototyping the Project</h3>
        <!--Would insert picture here if I had the source :) -->
        <p>There are several ways in which we could prototype our project. Both hardware and software components are critical to our idea. We can quite easily source the materials for locks, doors, shelving/locker units, and alarm systems. What we need to focus on in the stage of development is establishing what electrical hardware we need and how to produce a program that utilises and activates certain protocols such as locking and unlocking a door. An economical approach would be acquiring a raspberry pi and possibly an Arduino as the processor. Hypothetically if we have a running program, we can use the GPIOs in either device to test the process of opening a door and locking a door by responding to external stimuli. However, we need to be able to produce a program that registers the user accessing the locker which then sends a signal to the lock specifying the command. </p>
        <p>This is why it would be important to use both Arduino and Raspberry Pis. The raspberry pi would be the hub of the locker units and the Arduino will be connected to the Pis and trigger the required command. The reason we need a Pi for this is that it will be connected to the internet and be able to extract the required information from the user and send the request to the Arduino which then responds. The Pi acts as a middle-man between the data and the physical device. The Arduino is just the controller. <p>
        <p>We could just use a Pi for our first project which would be a trail of this broader concept because it has GPIO. This means it can act as a controller to the lock and also retrieve and send information to the web-based on what the user has requested. Using a Pi for the first phase of the project development we can prove our concept and establish any faults that may arise from using a single unit. Once we have learned what does or doesn’t work, we can then implement that into the second phase of the project. This step would look out how our program responds to multiple users interacting with the software. By taking this step we can determine the scalability of our program and determine if any adjustments would need to be made to the code to ensure there are miscommunications with the code or any potential errors with the code running.</p>
        <p>During the first phase of the hardware development of this project, we will need to consider how the device is powered. If it is installed in a central location like a train station, we should be able to establish some kind of cable connection to electricity. However, if we install the device in more isolated areas like parks, we may need to consider an alternative. Batteries could be a possibility however they can run flat and may require more frequent maintenance. Solar power would be a great idea to have it fixed to the roof of the units but a battery would need to be installed to conserve the power for after dark. Being in Melbourne, the majority of the days are often overcast which would significantly reduce the power generated which may result in brownouts. Even if those issues could be resolved there is also the issue of determining how much power each unit needs. Keep energy consumption low should be a priority during the initial phase of product development. </p>
        <p>We have discussed the possibility of using magnets as the main locking mechanism. Magnetic locks (maglocks) operate by an electrical current passing through metal plates that are drawn together (Maloney, E 2021). The benefits of maglocks are that they can withhold extreme forces, which would make them ideal as a deterrent from thieves. The downside is that they require continuous power to stay active. Continuous power means more electricity which means greater costs. Another disadvantage is that if there is a power outage the locks become ineffective (SecurCom, 2015). Electric bolt locks are another viable option. They are as strong as deadbolt locks and may only require power to operate when openings and closing (Maloney, E 2021). This could help reduce the costs. There are also Bluetooth locks that could be incorporated into the app that the user would have. Radiofrequency identification locks are another possibility but may require a physical device to enable the user to open the locker. </p>
        <p>Alternatively, we could conceive of a system like the trolley machines at supermarkets. Instead of entering a gold coin to unlock the trolley from the rest. The user pays for the service to securely store their personal belongings and is provided with a key. They have to pay a deposit for the key which they would receive back once the key is returned and just pay for the time, they have held onto it.  </p>
        <p>There are several paths we could choose to employ for the security feature of our locker. There isn’t really an easy choice. All kinds of locks/security systems can be exploited in one form or another. The security features in our device ultimately come down to how much people are willing to pay to securely store their belongings in a public place. It may require future modelling to determine what the best path would be. However, the primary focus moving forward should be to take all the ideas discussed above and produce some kind of functional prototype. </p>

        <h3>Designing the Database</h3>
        <p>During the project’s prototype design stage, it will be important to determine the specifications of data storage. Primarily, one would need to look at the type of data being stored, the most important of which being user data. This includes customer information (contact details), payment information, operating devices and potentially staff data. Other data series include locker information, facility information, transcripts and financing, though this is certainly non-exhaustive as there may be more aspects to consider about the project. </p>
        <p>Once all entities (i.e., customers, lockers, etc.) and relationships (i.e., a customer hires a locker) have been considered, it is good practice to model the data. Data models allow database designers to easily view the entities and relationships to incorporate into the system. It may also allow the data modeller to discover issues with the design, such as undiscovered entity or relationship requirements. “A mental model often contains unexamined assumptions; when you formalize the design, you discover these assumptions,” (IBM 2014, para. ‘Build a data model’). </p>
        <p>In order to capture and calculate large amounts of data, a database system would need to be considered. “Database software is used to create, edit, and maintain database files and records, enabling easier file and record creation, data entry, data editing, updating, and reporting,” (Oracle 2021, para. ‘What is database software?’). As databases systems differ in scope, pricing, licensing and features, it is similarly crucial to determine which database system would be suitable. Enterprise-systems such as Oracle would likely be too colossal to implement; hence, a smaller system such as SQLite or NoSQL would be more feasible in the prototyping stage. Larger data storage methods can be considered after project testing to ensure stability and cost-effectiveness. </p>
        <p>Nevertheless, a database system is necessary for the storage of the projects data. However, a database system requires staffing to be secure and compliant. Therefore, the effectiveness of the database is reliant on database administrators. “The explosion of data coming in from sensors, connected machines, and dozens of other sources keeps database administrators scrambling to manage and organize their companies’ data efficiently,” (Oracle 2021, para. ‘Database challenges’). </p>
        <p>Alternatively, a cloud database service could be used. Oracle (2021) describe cloud databases as “a collection of data, either structured or unstructured, that resides on a private, public or hybrid cloud computing platform,” (Oracle 2021, para. ‘Types of databases’). This reduces administrative load; there is less need for database administrators and physical hardware such as office computers. </p>
        <p>To reiterate, the data requirements of the project must be determined before considering a database. Once the requirements are examined, they should be modelled to present the entities and relationships between them. Alternatively, the requirements can be double-checked for errors using the data model. Finally, a database system is chosen, and a database designed using the final data model. </p>

        <h3>Enforcing the Security</h3>
        <p>In the infancy of prototyping the lockers it is unlikely that there would need to be a strong focus on the cybersecurity aspects of the prototype. Due to feasibility issues as well as scope focus the key mechanisms of the locker doing its primary function of unlocking/locking on command. For proof-of-concept purposes, it would be a vital component in reenforcing smooth operations and desired outcomes for us and the users alike.  </p>
        <p>Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting networks, data, and devices, in other words, sensitive information, from digital attacks. (CISA, 2019). Cybersecurity enforces secrecy, integrity, and availability of computer systems and data as they can be impaired by those with criminal intent or unauthorised access. It is the art of enforcing law and order in the virtual world. Cybersecurity is the oil which protects and maintains the engine of our project. The engine in this case are all the components: Database, Cloud storage, Rasperry PI/Arduino, and the power source. </p>
        <p>For our group’s project good cybersecurity practices will be enforced to ensure authorized access is given to the desired party.  </p>
        <p>Database: Protecting the user’s sensitive information is paramount in maintaining ethical operations. If a hacker is able to brute force user’s information such as Full Name, Phone Number, Billing Details, and or Address, the service fails in its key goals. We want user’s to access the product in full confidence of being safe and secure. Generally smaller companies that experience these type of data breaches carry a maintained perception of being unreliable. A contrarian example to this would be Sony’s mass data leak, where they have bounced back and held more positive public perception since the incident (Forbes, 2014) </p>
        <p>Cloud storage: A hacker should not access and be able to manipulate or halt queries aimed at the cloud database. For this to happen files should have adequate encryption, metadata should be encrypted and all communication channels are secured with SSL encryption, and the application should have protection against SQL injections. <p>
