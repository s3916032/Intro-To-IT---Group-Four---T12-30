        <h3>What is the ‘cloud’?</h3>
        <p>Cloud – appropriately named due to its looming, almost ‘ethereal’ presence – is a recent advancement in remote data storage and communication. It’s quite imposing: a remote library for your data, your friends’ data, and millions of other clients transmitting sensitive information from across the globe. However, it is not exclusive to file storage. Various other services have arisen over the course of cloud technology, such as video streaming and collaboration platforms. The potential for cloud computing is limitless, and the Information Technology world is skyrocketing because of it. So, what is cloud computing, what is its impact, and what could the cloud medium contribute to our society?</p>

        <h3>Elements of a Cloud Service</h3>
        <p>To extensively describe cloud computing, we should explore the various methods used today to implement such technologies. Dillon, Wu and Chang (2010, p. 27) explain that there are ‘five essential elements of cloud computing’. These involve on-demand self-service, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity, and measurability:For a cloud service to be considered self-serving, the client must be able to access resources present within the service instantaneously and without need of human interaction with the providers of such a service.Broad network access ensures that a client can access resources within the cloud remotely, using a range of accommodated devices.Resource pooling refers to a service’s ability to dynamically and efficiently store and allocate resources for multiple clients simultaneously. In addition, a pool-based cloud model generally provides a service in which the consumer has neither authority nor concern over the transmission of resources.The elasticity of a cloud service determines the speed at which it can provide and allocate resources, with such functions appearing infinite to its clients and needing no prior commitments to utilise.A measurable cloud service is one that ensures its infrastructure is capable of monitoring resource allocation between multiple clients.To briefly summarise, a cloud service must effectively provide instantaneous access to resources over the internet with support for multiple device formats. Additionally, efficient storage and resource allocation respective to its clients is crucial. Invisible and seemingly infinite process allocation assists with client convenience. Finally, the service as a whole must be measurable within the service’s infrastructure (Dillon, Wu & Chang 2010).</p>

        <h3>Sercice Models</h3>
        <p>Along with the five elements of cloud services, Dillon, Wu and Chang (2010, p. 28) describe four cloud service models which determine the distribution of resources. These models include Software as a Service, Platform as a Service, Infrastructure as a Service and Data storage as a Service: Cloud systems which employ Software as a Service (SaaS) models host clients’ software remotely, allowing consumers continuous access. Multiple applications are hosted the through the same infrastructure for efficiency. If the system serves multiple clients, their software is stored within a single environment to efficiently distribute resources (see resource pooling). Platform as a Service (PaaS) cloud models do not solely distribute software like SaaS models. Instead, they provide the tools and functionality to develop and host clients’ own software. Clients may also manage their own software remotely.Within Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS­­) environments, the cloud service’s infrastructure itself is provided to clients, allowing them to host their own services. The infrastructure is distributed using a separate virtual machine for each client. Services which employ Data storage as a Service ­­­­­­(DaaS) environments lease resources to clients for data storage purposes. Clients pay for the virtual storage of data instead of the database itself. These service models typically store greater amounts of data compared to traditional data storage methods.</p>

        <h3>Deployment Methods</h3>
        <p>The final characteristic of a cloud service is its method of deployment. This determines the overall demographic of the service. Dillon, Wu and Chang (2010, p. 28) explain four unique cloud service deployment models. These are known as public, private, community or hybrid cloud models:	Publicly deployed cloud models are indiscriminately marketed towards the general public and are free to be modified or managed by the service owner. These are the most common  cloud deployment methods.	As a whole, cloud technology is a series of computer resource hosting and distribution methods involving the lack of client-side physical computer architecture. This requires the cloud to provide continuous access to its resources, of which are seemingly infinite and instantaneously redistributable. Furthermore, cloud services may be hosted as software, software platform, infrastructure or data service models. These models affect the overall functionality cloud services provide to clients. Finally, services may be distributed exclusively within a single business, shared between multiple parties, or marketed towards the general public. Alternatively, it may be any combination of the three methods (Dillon, Wu & Chang 2010).</p>

        <h3>Impact of Cloud Technology</h3>
        <p>The recent adoption of cloud technology has caused it to branch into more publicly available mediums. These include video streaming services (i.e., YouTube or Netflix), file storage programs (i.e., Microsoft OneDrive or Dropbox), education platforms (i.e., Canvas or Slack) and, more recently, video game streaming services (i.e., Google Stadia or Project xCloud). Arguably, the most widespread and influential of these is YouTube, now owned and operated by Google. Debuting in the mid-2000s, it became one of the fastest-growing internet services in history. Soon, it was well-integrated in modern society. According to J, Hsu (2019, p. 9), video streaming represents more than fifty percent of all download internet traffic, with YouTube contributing to more than 10 percent. However, the service has become somewhat overshadowed by further advancements in the technology. For example, movie streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video offer customers a larger variety of paid media. Furthermore, these services generally provide higher video quality over its free-to-watch competitor. This higher quality requires an even greater amount of bandwidth to stream with gapless playback. Stadia, Google’s most recent streaming service, is a further testament to the ever-increasing demand for improvements in cloud technology. “Whereas live video streaming may have 500 milliseconds to manage possible network glitches without noticeable interruptions, Stadia could have just 16 milliseconds or less,” (J, Hsu 2019, p. 9). This enormous hurdle in streaming technology may give way to even greater cloud achievements in the future – perhaps even eliminating physical data storage entirely. Another recent emergence in cloud technology can be traced to the education sector. Instructure’s Canvas and Microsoft Teams are well-integrated collaboration platforms in modern education, especially after widespread remote transitions as a result of COVID-19. These platforms allow students and tutors to collaborate using forums, live video streaming and file hosting applications remotely and within a single ecosystem. If it weren’t for these cloud services, and with the extensive quarantine procedures still present in our society, students would need to rely on rudimentary learning methods. Most notably, there would be a distinct lack of peer communication, affecting the student’s social life considerably. This would certainly apply to all levels of dependent education; higher education students benefit from support from their tutors, lecturers and peers to achieve academically. </p>

        <h3>How Will Cloud Technology Affect Modern Generations?</h3>
        <p>The rapid expansion of cloud technology ensures that this question is essentially unanswerable. Arguably, the surfacing of recent education- and business-oriented cloud services has initiated redefinition of these aspects of life. Businesses which operate remotely cannot impose forced overtime or breakless workdays upon their workforce. Employees working remotely no longer require commutes to their workplaces, potentially improving their morale and stress levels. Conversely, students studying remotely may be negatively impacted by such a sudden paradigm shift. Typical school life involves peer collaboration and teacher feedback. Therefore, studying remotely may induce a lack of motivation for students. Alternatively, undergraduate and postgraduate students or research academics may find remote study to be beneficial. At this age, students are likely to be entirely independent. Thus, remote study could provide flexibility with study periods, social life and sleep, of which older students may need to pay more attention to. Regardless, cloud computing has made a substantial impact on typical lifestyles. To reiterate, cloud storage methods have enabled standard users to upload files instantaneously and automatically to their dedicated cloud storage applications such as Apple iCloud. Simultaneously, cloud has been utilised to stream large quantities of media content daily through platforms such as YouTube and Netflix. Recently, cloud solutions have provided a new option for video gaming  to consumers through platforms such as Stadia and Project xCloud.</p>
