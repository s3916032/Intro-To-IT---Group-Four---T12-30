          <h4>I was in charge of packaging the app for mobile use. I researched the best
            approach to achieve this outcome and supplied Simon with the requirements in
            order to be able to achieve the desired outcome. I was also in charge of setting up
            the app packaging from Python into an APK that would function on an Android smartphone.</h4>

        <h3>Scope and Limits </h3>
          <p>Considering app development, we decided to abandon the hope of developing
             an app in its native language as it required time and abilities far outside of our
             reach. None of us have experience with mobile app-specific programming
             languages and trying to learn one in 3 weeks was not feasible in my opinion.
             Our approach was to achieve a tangible outcome that we could physically
             present as a mobile app. This meant focusing on achieving a barebones
             prototype that would emulate our final desired app but in a very, very basic
             sense. This would give us a physical product to display rather than still working
             in drafts and ideas.</p>
          <p>Given more time we could look at implementing more
             features into our prototype however it is quite likely our process would be
             dramatically different if we were working within a larger timeframe.
             The idea was to achieve a deliverable over implementing infrastructure for the
             future development of our product. In that sense, our goals would likely shift if
             we look at achieving our ideal goal and a lot of the work done here would not
             be what would be required for the final product.</p>
      </div><br>
      <div class="sub-container">
        <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
          <p>Mobile App-specific programming knowledge is required. This includes Swift, Kotlin,
             Java to name a few.</p>
          <p>The required software is listed in bold with options written below:</p><br>
          <table>

          </table><br>
          <p>Hardware requirements include a computer as well as access to a smartphone
             which will provide a real-world test environment.</p>
          <p>Additional hardware requirements in terms of locker design will determine a
             number of things. The locker material, lock design, proprietary NFC reader are all to
             be determined in accordance with the design of the locker.</p>
      </div><br>
      <div class="sub-container">
        <h3>Testing</h3>
        <p>The true test for our app will be using it in conjunction with the physical lockers.
           This will require a working prototype of both platforms to be able to accomplish.
           This will likely only be achievable near the end stages of development as it would
           require both hardware and software to be in a near finished state.</p>
        <p>This will allow us to test the product in a real-world environment in order to receive
           user feedback regarding our product as well as our approach. The earlier we are
           able to achieve this the better however this is completely dependent on our
           approach and what aspects we aim to prioritize.</p>
