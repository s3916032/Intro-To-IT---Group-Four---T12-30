        <h3>What kind of work is done by the IT professional?</h3>
        <p>Igor is currently in more of leadership/management role thus his main tasks revolve around managing other people. He implements an agile working methodology which breaks up big tasks into smaller incremental goals. Most days he runs stand-ups (meetings where participants are typically standing) or scrum teams (mini meetings) which facilitates a ‘fast-paced development process’. He helps other people manage their work. He doesn’t actively undertake specific tasks but rather <i>‘I lead them by helping them manage loads and clearing the path for them so they can perform at their best’.</i></p>
        <p>Igor also described the typical day of the people he manages. A developer in his team would usually start the day with a Kanban (visual workflow platform) review to see what tasks have been completed, what needs doing, what needs reviewing, he described it as ‘part of the agile methodology’. Take part in a stand-up and discuss what was done the previous day. Some days they might have meetings with the <i>‘business part of the stakeholders, eliciting requirements or getting some approvals.’</i> They try to understand what problems they need to solve and enlist the help of senior staff if required. Most work is done in groups so almost all interactions are reported to the group.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with?</h3>
        <p>The type of people who Igor interacts with is highly dependent on his role. In his current capacity as the CTO of his own he interacts with his employees as well as his clients and customers. When you are within a typical mid-level IT role he says <i>‘You are probably more internal facing. There are very few that are external facing.’</i> So you are more likely to be interacting with you colleagues and others within your workplace rather than people who are situated outside such as clients and stakeholders. </p>
        <p>The bigger the business the less likely you are to have external contact. You are more likely to be ‘part of an internal it team, kind of part of a machine’. Very unlikely to be the person someone looks to seek out within that business.  However internally you are likely to have to meet with employees who require problems to be solved. <i>‘So again, it's taking those things that they get fed from their business counterparts. So when I say business counterparts, I mean, people that work like in the call centre or in the accounts department or et cetera, right? So that's called the business.’</i>) In your role as a developer or engineer you will likely have to design solutions tailor made to the issue and you learn about these issues through communication with employees within the business.  </p>
        <br>
        <h3>What should you focus on studying/acquiring as an IT professional?</h3>
        <p>A lot of the technological knowledge in the IT field is easy to acquire. Igor says <i>‘I hate certifications. I am certified in a couple of things, but I only do them if I can get it for free. But I just find they're a waste of time, waste of money.’</i> He mentions it is very easy to learn on the job and most companies will finance your study if it is required. It isn’t worth it simply upskilling hoping it will come in use one day. You need to tailor your skills to the tasks at hand and most often you can also learn on the job. </p>
        <p>Igor says that today he looks to hire people based on attitude over raw technical knowledge. Alluding to that point he mentioned that he would look to hire based on what problems they have solved before and if a similar problem is something he needs address compared to just looking at general technical knowledge. <i>‘So when I'm interviewing someone, I will say, okay, I have the following problem, right? I let's say this, right. I need to be able to verify a service being delivered at a, you know, across thousands of users. Let's say, you know, someone comes to doing your lawns and I want to verify it. I need to do it via two-way SMS system. So tell me where in the past you have built a two-way SMS system and what problems did you face and how did you overcome them?’</i></p>
        <p>Furthermore he mentions <i>‘So ability to sell the ability to influence people, ability to be articulate both in verbal form and in written form those efficient, in the tech field, those skills are like, hen's teeth so if you have them, you will be a lot more valuable than they, you know, 99% people.’</i> These are the factors he considers when looking at possible employees and what he believes is essential to consider when looking for jobs within the IT field. </p>
        <br>
        <h3>What aspect of their position is most challenging?</h3>
        <p class="tab"><i>‘The most fun part is engaging in research of the stuff I hate is you know, administrative things and more sort of repetitive tasks and stuff like that, you know, don't have create weight where you can't use creativity or yeah. And I actually, I do prefer tasks that require a group of people. I'm not like a single developer. I like actually being social.’</i></p>
        <br>
        <p>Igor finds most administrative tasks challenging as its repetitive and carry no creative weight. He finds creative outlets more engaging and thus when that outlet doesn’t exist the task at hand seems monotonous and boring. As IT work predominantly operates in a group environment Igor finds that very beneficial as he thrives in a group dynamic rather that of a lone wolf. He enjoys the social aspect the group provides. </p>
        <br>
        <h3>How do you recommend IT professionals prepare for the future in the industry?</h3>
        <p>Igor mentioned that technology moves fast. <i>‘So look at where the future's going know, look at the, sort of the bleeding edge now, by the time you're going to be out in the workforce is going to be mainstream…Neurolink is going to put cables in your brain, like seems insane. Now look, five, 10 years, Normal. You know I think like AI that will just do stuff, like, look at science fiction. This is ridiculous. 50 years away. It's not 50 years away. It's like five years away, Like self-driving cars, I have a Tesla already and let me tell you, I do very little driving it's, it's the norm. So get ready for that. Don't lag behind. Well, lagging behind things, you end up working at a bank.’</i></p>
        <p>So as someone looking to gain a standing within this field he advises to not be left behind in this fast paced environment. Never ignore possibilities, look to gain skills that will also be relevant in the future rather than what is relevant now. Don’t discount possibilities, find a passion and look to gear yourself for the forefront of possibility than be grounded in reality.  </p>
