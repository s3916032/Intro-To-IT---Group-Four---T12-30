        <h3>Arjun Kumar</h3>
        <p><IMG SRC="img\Arjun Headshot.jpg" style="float:left;width:200px;height:300px;padding-right:15px;padding-bottom:5px" >Hi I’m Arj. Originally hailing from India having moved to Australia in 2002 I spent most of my childhood in various locations in Australia ranging from Alice Springs to Hobart and finally in Launceston, Tasmania. I moved to Melbourne to pursue further studies and have called it home since. I follow a number of sports both as a hobby and an interest although I particularly enjoy soccer as I am a keen Liverpool supporter.</p>
        <p>My interest in IT stems from several sources. Primarily I got into computers through gaming. As a result I started to learn how computers work in order to eek out as much performance as possible from my ancient rig. My dad was also quite interested in new technologies as they were made available and this further enabled me to explore new things such as smartphones, iPods/Pads, wireless tech, etc. without the associated costs to bear. Over the years technology has moved at a rapid pace and it is something I still know very little about. Thus I hope to expand my knowledge and get a better understanding of the IT sphere through my studies here at RMIT.</p>
        <p>I possess very little in terms of job specific experience in the IT field. I have tinkered with hardware, played with BIOS settings and have a good understanding when it comes to computer hardware. However I have never really ventured into the software side of things apart from a brief stint with Photoshop and video editing.</p>

        <h3>Liam Folie</h3>
        <p><IMG SRC="img\liam_Headshot.jpg" style="float:right;width:250px;height:300px;padding-left:15px;padding-bottom:5px"> My name is Liam Folie, I went to high school in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Photography is my creative outlet. I couldn’t say I’ve always had an interest in IT. We use technology every day but often don’t understand how it works but by taking the time to learn we can do some incredible things. I like to know how things work. I want to be more than just a user of these devices.</p>
        <p>This healthy obsession likely developed shortly after learning how to use photoshop. The initial stages of learning how to use a program like that can be daunting and often frustrating. Eventually, I learned to be patient and was able to see the unprecedented impact this software had on my abilities to create. This experience, I believe, triggered my desire to learn more about IT.</p>

        <h3>Simon Bird</h3>
        <p><IMG SRC="img\simon.png" style="float:left;width:250px;height:300px;padding-right:15px;padding-bottom:5px">Hello! My name is Simon Bird. I was born and raised in suburban Western Australia until the age of 13, when I moved to Tasmania. Growing up, I had a fascination for technology, especially Word processing and troubleshooting. Instead of doing schoolwork I expended my youth doodling in the margins of my sole workbook. This has not changed. My grade six teacher frequently summoned me to fix the interactive whiteboard which never needed anything but a mere 10-second calibration. This earned me a certificate with the fringe benefit of imposter syndrome.</p>
        <p>Throughout high school, I created small games (that nobody played) with Scratch, Adobe Flash, and then GameMaker Studio. I was eventually given the opportunity to present one at a school trade show. Enthused by programming, I moved into higher education seeking a career in IT. I am aiming to become a Systems Analyst, where I can forever tell people that what they’re doing is wrong and get paid for it. This has little to do with programming, so I might develop games that nobody will play on the side.</p>
        <p>Nowadays I enjoy playing games and developing them, provided I actually feel like it (never). Otherwise, I love The Simpsons and browsing random garbage on the internet. </p>

        <h3>Alan Fogel</h3>
        <p><IMG SRC="img\Alan.jpg" style="float:right;width:200px;height:300px;padding-left:15px;padding-bottom:5px">Hey as you may have already read a couple times my name is Alan Fogel, I’m a 20-year-old male from a little old suburb called Caulfield. I’ve lived in the same house my whole life, however, my older sister and parents bounced between a few houses for about 7 years until I was born when they settled with the home that I’ve been raised in.</p>
        <p>My parents have been a massive influence on me, they instilled a very European mindset onto me I’ve grown up only playing and watching soccer. Another interest/hobby that I have (as much as my Mum hates it) is gaming; I’m a very competitive person and feel like it’s a fun avenue to exhaust into sometimes. Plus, it feeds my ego when I get called a ‘Sweat Lord’.</p>
