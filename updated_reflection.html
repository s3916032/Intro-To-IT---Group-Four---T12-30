        <h3>Liam Folie</h3>
        <p>I am satisfied with the final outcomes. We worked well together. The team made an
        effort to help each other out when needed. There was constructive feedback when
        we shared our ideas. The experience has taught me that there is so much work
        involved in the process of mobile app development.</p>
        <p>There could have been improvements in our communication and organization of
        files. We all have different methods of how we do things. If we were able to develop
        a consistent method across these areas we may have been able to work with
        increase efficiency.</p>
        <p>Github is still moderately confusing for me to use in a group setting. I made
        multiple mistakes when trying to make commits that affect the main files.
        Fortunately, Simon was able to revert these changes. I just found the terminology
        confusing. With more practice, I am sure it will become easier to navigate.</p>

        <h3>Simon Bird</h3>
        <p>I believe that as a team, we work very well together. We are collaborative, yet we
        have initiative. We are modest, yet we understand our strengths and weaknesses.
        Despite one of our team members disappearing on us, we remained determined to
        produce a meaningful project outcome.</p>
        <p>I think we could have improved our communication more than we hoped to, based
        on prior feedback. There were some hiccups regarding files and formats, app bugs,
        etc., that could have been amended faster using collaborative tools like OneNote
        (nobody likes the OneNote ☹).</p>
        <p>The amount of work needed to create a simple mobile app was quite surprising, as
        was having one of our group members leave mid-project. Despite this, I believe we
        managed to pull through and create a decent project in the end.along the way.</p>

        <h3>Arjun Kumar</h3>
        <p>Coming into this project we had new and fresh ideas about how to organise
        ourselves to avoid the hurdles we encountered as a group last time. Through the
        initial phase of our project, we managed to incorporate some of these ideas into our
        meetings and workflow. However, due to work commitments outside of this project
        and a group member going AWOL things started to break down a little bit over time.</p>
        <p>The communication aspect between the remaining members was still good but the
        deliverables were not always addressed in a timely fashion. This again led to a
        crunch time near the submission due date. This could also partly be blamed on the
        remaining members having to shoulder the workload that was left behind by Alan
        leaving. This time of year is quite busy for university work and this placed an extra
        burden on time management.</p>
        Our final approach was also not as systematic as it could have been in order to
        avoid having to chase people up for work at the end. It was also apparent when
        collating that many aspects were written from a person’s POV rather than as the
        group. This required a lot of editing in order to maintain a cohesive group report.
        <p>At the end of the day, we still managed to deliver the outcome that we set out to
        achieve and that is something we can be happy and proud of. Even through the
        problems we faced we still managed to meet the expectations that we placed on
        ourselves.</p>

        <h3>Our Final Thoughts</h3>
          <p>Communication, collaboration, quality of work, and transparency between
          remaining group members were all aspects of the project that went well.
          Time management, writing approach and meeting the brief were all things that
          could have been done better. This could have led to a more seamless transition
          when collating and bringing everything together in the final document and website.</p>
          <p>Surprisingly even though we lost a team member during this project we managed to
          rally and produce the outcome that we had initially set out to achieve. In essence,
          there was little lost.</p>
          <p>All in all even though there is definite room for improvement we worked quite well
          as a team in challenging circumstances. The goals that we set were never altered
          and managing to achieve them leads us to believe that what we have done is
          something to be proud of.</p>
