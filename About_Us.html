        <h3>Arjun Kumar</h3>
        <IMG SRC="img\Arjun Headshot.jpg" style="float:left;padding-right:15px;padding-bottom:5px">
        <p>Hi I’m Arj. Originally hailing from India having moved to Australia in 2002 I spent most of my childhood in various locations in Australia ranging from Alice Springs to Hobart and finally in Launceston, Tasmania. I moved to Melbourne to pursue further studies and have called it home since. I follow a number of sports both as a hobby and an interest although I particularly enjoy soccer as I am a keen Liverpool supporter.</p>
        <p>My interest in IT stems from several sources. Primarily I got into computers through gaming. As a result I started to learn how computers work in order to eek out as much performance as possible from my ancient rig. My dad was also quite interested in new technologies as they were made available and this further enabled me to explore new things such as smartphones, iPods/Pads, wireless tech, etc. without the associated costs to bear. Over the years technology has moved at a rapid pace and it is something I still know very little about. Thus I hope to expand my knowledge and get a better understanding of the IT sphere through my studies here at RMIT.</p>
        <p>I possess very little in terms of job specific experience in the IT field. I have tinkered with hardware, played with BIOS settings and have a good understanding when it comes to computer hardware. However I have never really ventured into the software side of things apart from a brief stint with Photoshop and video editing.</p>

        <h3>Liam Folie</h3>
        <p><IMG SRC="img\liam_Headshot.jpg" style="float:right;padding-left:15px;padding-bottom:5px"> My name is Liam Folie, I went to high school in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Photography is my creative outlet. I couldn’t say I’ve always had an interest in IT. We use technology every day but often don’t understand how it works but by taking the time to learn we can do some incredible things. I like to know how things work. I want to be more than just a user of these devices.</p>
        <p>This healthy obsession likely developed shortly after learning how to use photoshop. The initial stages of learning how to use a program like that can be daunting and often frustrating. Eventually, I learned to be patient and was able to see the unprecedented impact this software had on my abilities to create. This experience, I believe, triggered my desire to learn more about IT.</p>

        <h3>Simon Bird</h3>
        <p><IMG SRC="img\simon.png" style="float:left;padding-right:15px;padding-bottom:5px">Hello! My name is Simon Bird. I was born and raised in suburban Western Australia until the age of 13, when I moved to Tasmania. Growing up, I had a fascination for technology, especially Word processing and troubleshooting. Instead of doing schoolwork I expended my youth doodling in the margins of my sole workbook. This has not changed. My grade six teacher frequently summoned me to fix the interactive whiteboard which never needed anything but a mere 10-second calibration. This earned me a certificate with the fringe benefit of imposter syndrome.</p>
        <p>Throughout high school, I created small games (that nobody played) with Scratch, Adobe Flash, and then GameMaker Studio. I was eventually given the opportunity to present one at a school trade show. Enthused by programming, I moved into higher education seeking a career in IT. I am aiming to become a Systems Analyst, where I can forever tell people that what they’re doing is wrong and get paid for it. This has little to do with programming, so I might develop games that nobody will play on the side.</p>
        <p>Nowadays I enjoy playing games and developing them, provided I actually feel like it (never). Otherwise, I love The Simpsons and browsing random garbage on the internet. </p>

        <h3>Alan Fogel</h3>
        <p><IMG SRC="img\Alan.jpg" style="float:right;padding-left:15px;padding-bottom:5px">Hey as you may have already read a couple times my name is Alan Fogel, I’m a 20-year-old male from a little old suburb called Caulfield. I’ve lived in the same house my whole life, however, my older sister and parents bounced between a few houses for about 7 years until I was born when they settled with the home that I’ve been raised in.</p>
        <p>My parents have been a massive influence on me, they instilled a very European mindset onto me I’ve grown up only playing and watching soccer. Another interest/hobby that I have (as much as my Mum hates it) is gaming; I’m a very competitive person and feel like it’s a fun avenue to exhaust into sometimes. Plus, it feeds my ego when I get called a ‘Sweat Lord’.</p>
        <p>In terms of IT Interests (outside of gaming) I really enjoy programs that allow me to design various things, for example programs such as Google Sketch Up were my best friends for significant parts of my childhood. I found it a good way to express and cultivate my creativity. Another key interest in IT that I have is Robotics, as well as being creative it also helped me with learning the basics of coding/programming with the robot’s output being tangible results to learn from.</p>

        <h3>Arjun Kumar</h3>
        <p>My Myers-Briggs test result indicated that I am an Assertive Advocate, INFJ. My Learning Styles Test indicated that I am primarily a Visual Learner. My Big Five Personality test score was in the high percentiles for Emotional Stability and Conscientiousness, median scores for Agreeableness and Intellect/Imagination (indicating more conventional rather than imaginative thinker) and quite a low score for Extroversion.</p>
        <p>Utilising the information garnered from my test results. I am an organized and diligent worker who likes a workplace where there is a schedule and clear outline of the tasks that need to be performed. I am mindful of the people around me and would like to see them succeed as much as I would like to succeed myself. I believe this is a great quality in a team environment where the success of the group outweighs the success of the individual.</p>
        <p>I am unlikely to let people face unnecessary hardships and will bring such matters to light however I am unlikely to create conflict unless I see a great wrong being done. I am empathetic and sensitive and thus an integral part of a group dynamic. But as I hold myself to such a high regard, I might also be quite sensitive to constructive criticism and might not always take it well. I will absorb information best through visual aids rather than audio. I will also get better at tasks the more I do them. I am likely to be a calm presence in a team dynamic. A voice of reason. </p>

        <h3>Liam Folie</h3>
        <p>There is a debate around the validity of these tests and the results in determining someone’s character. I do believe they can offer some personal insight and personal reflection on what our characteristics are. I do think these tests can offer individuals/teams an opportunity to reflect. I believe they can encourage us to think about what our strengths and weakness are and how we might behave in a team. I also think results can also provide insight into new terminology to help individuals/businesses determine what life/working style choice might lead to greater satisfaction.</p>
        <p>With that in mind, I do relate to some of the traits of this personality type. I am independent and strive to do things in my way. Adhering to specific rules and conventions can feel like a hindrance to my success. Whenever I make any important decisions, I tend to do them in a rational and informed manner. I like to think about the pros and cons of various outcomes and by doing research I have the self-assurance to stand up for my ideas.</p>
        <p>What I found interesting from the Myers Briggs test is that when I took it several years ago my personality type was in a different category. I think these results offer a snapshot of who I am right now but I would be curious to see if anything changes in a few years, or maybe even a few months.</p>

        <h3>Simon Bird</h3>
        <p>As an ISFP, I enjoy life as it is and try to avoid conflict. I tend to be fairly outgoing, but very reserved, and I might take some time to open up around other people. I abhor narcissism, favouritism and superiority while favouring honesty and acceptance.</p>
        <p>My result from a VARK learning style questionnaire is multimodal. I prefer to learn through visual, kinematic and reading/writing methods.</p>
        <p>My result from the Kellogg North-western University’s Creativity Test is very creative with a score of 70 out of 116. I prefer to innovate – or think outside the box – when trying to solve problems. This is likely the leading factor of my infatuation for programming, doodling and game design.</p>
        <p>My personality can evidently make or break a group. I prefer not to lead and hate being the centre of attention. I love to help others, but I feel shut down if my efforts are ignored or criticised. Therefore, I need a reciprocating team, lest I feel unwanted and avoid collaborating out of fear of rejection. If my efforts do go noticed, I can be a powerhouse where I strive to improve the quality of life of my colleagues.</p>
        <p>This gives me the opportunity to oversee collaborative services and tools and assist other members with troubleshooting and general advice. For example, I could manage the Microsoft Teams group and GitHub repositories, aiding with such tools to those who need it.</p>
        <p>Simultaneously, my creative drive enables me to contribute to design elements of documents, programs and sites with the team. For example, I could help design the project website and report. I can quickly find solutions to programming problems, assist with conventional mistakes and compile material from other members.</p>

        <h3>Alan Fogel</h3>
        <p>My Myers-Briggs result is eerily similar to me and always evokes a feeling of being watched every time I read it as I feel it describes me better than I could ever. It perfectly describes my creativity and love for tinkering with things, which is what I’ve always carried with messing around and fixing hardware/software.</p>
        <p>The Online Learning Style test showed that I am predominantly a tactile learner and interestingly falls in accordance with my Myers-Briggs results of Virtuoso. </p>
        <p>I am happy that I didn’t rank too high in the Psychopath Online Test. I think that having some level of compassion and morality is important for working in teams and in projects that could affect the world to various degrees.</p>
        <p>To mix it all together, I am an extremely logic centred person who needs to be involved to feel truly passionate about a project or assignment. I don’t crave power or leadership positions as I am a tad shy, but I know from past events (Captain of soccer teams and schoolhouse captain), when I’m passionate about something I am an extremely uplifting and effective leader. I can be a tad selfish, and results driven, as shown by my Myers-Briggs results, but if managed I can be an amazing part of team as I am able to synergise with any type of team member and bring the best out of myself as well as my team-members without it being an authoritarian. </p>
