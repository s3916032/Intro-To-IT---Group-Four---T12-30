        <h3>Alan Fogel</h3>
        <p>This assignment was good a learning lesson for how group projects should be conducted and how tweaks can be made tov improve it. We tried getting onto the front foot by setting up our communication pathways and organisation tools as early as possible, this helped with assigning clear roles and direction of the recorded meetings. As a group we all tackled the issue of being “forever online” quite well, there were some instances of extraneous circumstances when one or more team members couldn’t attend classes or meetings.</p>
        <p>I feel as a whole, the team did very well to make each other feel accommodated and thought of. I feel that something we could’ve improved on were tracking/reporting our progress more diligently as well as sticking to our “soft” deadlines. I especially think that I must improve in these aspects as they would go a long way in helping each team member have a clear view of our progress. Furthermore, aide in having a distinct vision of task. We may have also struggled with finding a specific direction but that seemed to be compensated in the meetings.</p>
        <p>A surprising aspect of this assignment was how well we all gelled together, considering the predicament that we found ourselves in. We managed to sustain a positive attitude and friendly connections, despite never meeting in person. I’d usually expect a cesspool of testosterone filled disagreements and it was polar opposite, we had our fun times, but it was generally professional. Working in this assignment has shown me how important it is for everyone to be a leader of some sorts, having the courage to ask questions as well as the ability to offer your ideas on the contrary to things. </p>

        <h3>Liam Folie</h3>
        <p>This assignment was a pleasant challenge. Although I am used to communicating with friends and family over the internet, working in a team in a purely online environment was an exceptional hurdle that I feel we all managed to overcome. An area I think could be improved is our communication. Not to say we did not do a good job; I just think it could have been improved. Specifically, in regards to formulating a more defined sense of direction at the start of the project.
        <p> I found it surprising that we all had different skill levels and ideas. It’s probably a no-brainer but when discussing certain topics and trying to figure out the best way to tackle certain aspects of the assessment, I could see we all had something unique to offer. Unless there is someone assigned as the leader of the group, it can be hard to determine who should be in charge. Not to say there needs to be an authoritarian micromanager but having someone hold the team together and lead us in a direction that we can all follow is important. </p>
        <p>As a team, we delegated a person to overseas each section of the assessment based on the titles defined in the assessment guideline, this can be seen in the Tasks section of Microsoft Teams. I think my contribution to the tools section was sufficient. One thing I was happy with was taking segments of the assessment document and breaking them down into different boards to help us visualise what was required for each section </p>

        <h3>Simon Bird</h3>
        <p>As the assignment itself is fairly intense, I believe there was a good attempt at the project as a whole. Early on, a lot of effort was put into setting up the Teams platform, but motivation seemed to fall off shortly after. Primarily, the IT technologies section was to be completed first. However, it was one of the last sections to be completed. This could somewhat be attributed to various factors. For example, Alan had issues from the beginning with his computer malfunctioning. Arjun and I had three other courses to attend to and Liam had work obligations. </p>
        <p>Regardless, I believe that we have pulled through and put together some good material as a team. I was quite surprised to find that my group doesn’t have as much experience in IT as me, assuming that I am the youngest member. This could be expectable in retrospect, since IT subjects such as programming and web design are only somewhat recently being integrated into high schools. This assessment has taught me that it’s not the grades that matter, but the thumbs-up reactions we made along the way. </p>

        <h3>Arjun Kumar</h3>
        <p>This assignment was quite a unique challenge that I had not experienced before. Most group work that I have completed in the past was always conducted in a physical setting and having to complete all aspects of this assignment online was interesting, challenging and a sign of the times. </p>
        <p>I thoroughly enjoyed our group meetings and I felt they were a good combination of work and fun. There was always a baseline of professionalism in regards to tasks but the environment was always relaxed and friendly. We were organised and diligent for the most part. We started with a clear outline of how we wanted to approach this assignment and promptly allocated tasks with due dates. </p>
        <p>There were a few things that could have been improved. Due to unforeseen circumstances our initial outline and plan had to be rescheduled and as a result I felt that things started to break down a little bit. Some aspects of communication were missing when it came to showing up to meetings and reporting on progress. We were not utilising the resources at hand to keep track of progress and as result we had to enter a crunch close to the due date. I do feel I personally contributed to this dilemma. In addition, we weren't particularly flexible with workloads, once assigned a task it was expected of you to complete that task regardless of any obstacles that you might face. </p>
        <p>Something that surprised me was how well we got along even without having met each other in real life. What was initially envisioned to be 20-minute group meetings often went on for over an hour. An aspect of this might be the fact that we are all lacking in social interaction due to the lockdown in Melbourne so this was a surprising but welcome respite. Even though everything didn't necessarily go to plan everyone in our group was positive and supportive. We never really had any issues in terms of group dynamic and we kind of just wanted everyone to pull through together. .</p>

        <h3>Our Thoughts</h3>
        <p>We had a clear plan how we wanted to split tasks from the get go and we have basically almost stuck to it. Towards the end some polish needed to be applied to some areas and thus some tasks were further split between people who addressed those issues. But for the most part we think we managed a somewhat even workload. </p>
        <p>As a group we were probably missing a leader who was keeping tabs on everyone and updating progress as required. This could have avoided a lot of the issues we faced towards the end of our assignment. </p>
