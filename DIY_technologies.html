      <h3>What does it do?</h3>
      <div class="sub-container">
        <p>To simplify, think of them as small as a small computer on a single board (Prasad, 2013). These devices can be segmented into two categories, single-board com-puters, SBCs, and single-board microcontrollers, SBMs. SBCs contains all the necessary components to operate as a standard computer and have broader applications. This includes purposes such as running an operting system (OS) like Linux, browsing the internet, and using programs like Atom and GIMP. In contrast, SBMs are specialized computers with a “primary focus of accessing and interacting with other hardware” (Sebastian, 2021, para. 3). You can’t run operating systems on them but you can program them to do specific tasks to utilize their general-purpose input/output (GPIO) pins. </p>
        <p>Although not as powerful as modern-day PCs, they can offer many advantages. Both devices consume consid-erably less power than modern PCs making them en-ergy efficient and produce less heat, portability is in-credible as most are the size of a credit card, affordability they are small and cheap to produce. The affordability and power that come with these devices offer a variety of applications.</p>
        <p>There are several manufacturers for both SBCs and SBMs. The most well-known of them are Raspberry Pi and Arduino. Makey Makey is another well-known brand primarily focusing on kits to educate and inspire children, their devices tend to be more or less on par with the SBMs like Arduino. The primary benefit of both devices is that they both contain GPIOs. This offers electronic and/or computer enthusiasts a myriad of applications. They can be used as routers, website servers, network ad-blockers, and even retro game consoles (William, G 2020).</p>
        <p>The conceptual framework of these devices harks back to the early days of electronic computing (Barnat, C 2021). Ever since the commercialization of computers, there has been a demand to have fast and more efficient machines. Fast forward several decades and we now have a mature market for these specific devices. </p>
        <p>In 2005 a few designers in Ivrea, Italy were developing a project low-cost SBM that was easy to use across all ages and skill levels. This was the start of the Arduino. Shortly after, a team from the University of Cam-bridge’s Computer Laboratory saw a need to produce a low-cost SBC that could increase accessibility to students who wanted to learn to program.</p>
        <p>This device became known as the Raspberry Pi and was officially launched in 2012. Although, it was intended to be a tool for students it quickly became popular amongst makers, engineers, hobbyists, and children. What makes both Arduino and Raspberry Pi so special is that their hardware and software are both open-sourced. Open-sourced hardware and software means that the source code, design files, and documentation can be freely accessible and modified by anyone as long as they do the same (Opensource.com, n.d). Proprietary or closed-source means that the original creators have exclusive rights and control over it, basically any large tech company.</p>
        <p>Alongside these developments, other companies have arisen like Adafruit and Makey Makey as alternatives and often complementary accessories to the expand-ing market of DIY tech. Adafruit was founded in 2005 by engineer Limor Fried (Adafruit, n.d). Makey Makey is another who produce ‘invention kits’ inspired by the maker movement(Makey Makey, n.d). The maker movement is a name given to an evolving community of employing do-it-yourself (DIY) and do-it-with others (DIWO) techniques and practices to develop non-commercialises technological products.</p>
        <p>They are back by communities of passionate engineers, computer scientists, programmers and enthusi-asts who want to see more engagement with the broader community. DIY tech offers users the opportunity to take back control of the electronics we use in everyday life by understanding the building blocks that make them.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
        <p>The applications that are driving the growth for SBCs range across areas such as ATMs, industrial computers, medical equipment automation equipment. Alongside developments in wireless communication, software development, advances in areas such as product design, increasing computing power, and energy consumption the international SBC “market size is expected to reach $3.8 billion by 2026” (KBV Research, 2020).</p>
        <p>The research from KBV does present some enforcing figures. However, there have been fewer launches of new SBCs. Perhaps this is due to the increased difficulty in producing sophisticated hardware for the market (Barnat, C 2021). An additional challenge is maintaining a community to help develop open-source software.As the sophistication of the technology develops, simply relying on the community contribution is not viable. What we could see in the future is segmentation in the market with a demand for high-end hardware at one end and low-cost computers at the other. </p>
        <p>By offering young minds and enthusiasts an approachable entryway to the world of electronics and computing, these devices have and will likely continue to have an incredible impact inspiring the next generation of software and hardware developers. The affordability of these devices enables students to learn how com-puters work, offers affordable prototyping components for tech entrepreneurs, and providers the maker community greater access to tech deploy in their projects.</p>
        <p>I am unsure most people will be using these devices because not everyone will find them appealing. Raspberry Pis and Arduinos have marketed themselves as educational tools for children so I can imagine that they would be used in school environments in future years to encourage the next generation to consider careers in technology as it is becoming an ever-expanding industry.</p>
        <p>The affordability of these devices is advantageous as it offers greater accessibility to computers in disadvantaged communities. They also have the added benefit of allowing educators to share and inspire the next generation. I don’t think it will replace or make any jobs redundant that haven’t already been replaced by technology. These devices are marketed towards electronic and computer enthusiasts.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
        <p>The more research I have done into these devices I have developed a keen interest in acquiring my own to learn more about electronics, computing, and the applications these tools can have and finding my creative ways to use the tools. These devices are aesthetically raw and expose the intricacies of modern electronics. They aren’t slick aluminium cased products selling an idea. They are an enabler of electronic discovery and innovation. I even purchased a raspberry pi myself and am keen to learn how to use the GPIOs. I want to learn how to use Linux systems and look at using the GPIOs to create some basic scripts that utilise the various accessories that can be added to the pi.</p>
        <p>These devices run on Linux and to utilize these tools for my own life it will be a requirement to learning this operating system. I see this as a great opportunity to gain exposure to the various Linux distros which will, in turn, benefit my goals to work in IT. Another advantage to these devices is the opportunity it provides me to learn about electronics which I have never had before.</p>
        <p>What excites me most about researching these tools is the maker community. There is a community of enthusiasts who have created some fascinating things with these SBCs and SBMs at the core. Many of these projects wouldn’t have been achievable without the accessibility projects like Arduino and raspberry pi have offered to the broader community. They make computing and electronics fun and exciting, often demystifying complex ideas into tangible assets that can expand anyone knowledge in an approachable way.</p>
        <p>I am inspired by these incredible devices. However, it cannot be denied that SBCs and SBMs are niche products. They aren’t for everybody.Theycan be intimidating for many who have only use modern PCs and smartphones. They are computers that have been stripped to the bone which can seem frightening to any novice.  However, they provide an accessible entry point to understanding the building blocks of our tech-orientated world, anyone can use them as an opportunity to learn more about how computers work.</p>
