        <h3>Scope and Limits </h3>
        <p>When reviewing Liam’s initial UI design, I decided which parts of the
          application were feasible enough to produce in a couple of weeks. I chose the
          splash page, login and register pages, PIN page and a simple page with a few
          buttons to hire and unlock lockers.</p>
        <p>It was important to develop the
          functionality of the app prior to the design, so Liam’s rigorous app design was,
          sadly, unlikely to see itself as fully functional.</p>
        <p>The splash page would be a simple logo on the screen which transitions to the
          login page after a few seconds. A simple step, but an important one. Once a
          splash screen and transition is set up, I can create more screens for the app.</p>
        <p>The login page is a basic username/password field. I pondered the possibilities
          of user storage: Should I store user data in a separate file, or temporarily keep it
          in memory (as a variable)? I opted for the separate file since I could learn how
          to properly manipulate files in Python. The user file only stores one entry, which
          should be enough to showcase the login function.</p>
        <p>The register page is nearly identical to the login page, but with one key
          difference: it saves the file instead of reading it. Neat!</p>
        <p>The PIN page reads the user file for a different PIN entry. Only one PIN should
          be saved at once, much like the user file.</p>
        <p>Finally, the main page has three buttons. Each button unlocks or locks a ‘locker’
          (this was changed to hiring the locker before unlocking it with a separate
          button), which is a simple text box with the locker’s ID. The app should only
          allow the user to unlock a locker if the locker has shared a randomly generated
          token with them. The user can also change their user details from this page and
          log out (this was not incorporated in the end).</p><br><br>
        <a class="sub-button" href="https://appetize.io/app/9hzcd15ah7pv0zave9ydqjz4nc">App Sandbox</a><br><br>
        <p>The final application would need a range of improvements. However, with the
          current prototype and Liam’s UI example, it is easy to see the direction to take
          with continuing development:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The login and register page need buttons to switch between.</li>
          <li>The user info should be securely stored online and allow multiple users at once.</li>
          <li>The layout of each screen needs to be updated to match the design prototype.</li>
          <li>The user should have access to their account information.</li>
          <li>The locker functionality should be overhauled once physical artifacts are created.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>And so forth.</p>

        <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
        <p>Early on, we discussed which platform to develop the app with. We agreed that
          Python 3.9 is a good choice, as we have considerable creative freedom creating with
          it. I could also incorporate third-party modules to assist with mobile-specific
          development.</p>
        <p>The majority of the development would be done through JetBrains’ PyCharm
          (2021.1.3), a robust and very famous Python IDE. We each have some experience with
          this program, as our programming classes extensively involve it.</p>
        <p>The original applet module that Liam shared was called ‘guizero’ (1.2.0) by Laura
          Sach. This was useful as a very basic app draft.</p>
        <p>The newer mobile application module is called ‘Kivy’ (2.0.0). I have never used Kivy
          prior to this project.</p>
        <p>Each of these are free to use, with PyCharm offering a free student edition with
          additional resources.</p>
      </div><br>
      <div class="sub-container">
        <h3>Testing</h3>
        <p>Testing the app would be done primarily by us. PyCharm allows rapid app testing
          and debugging. If the Python project is hosted on GitHub, Arjun, Liam and Alan
          could contribute to testing if desired. Unfortunately, it is impossible to package the
          app in this phase.</p>
        <p>Thus, user testing is essentially impossible. Arjun’s role is important here; once the
          app is ported to mobile, we could show it to users and receive real feedback.</p>
